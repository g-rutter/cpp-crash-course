// EXERCISES
// 14-3. Write a program that uses the Stopwatch class in Listing 12-25 to determine
//       the runtime performance of std::advance when given a forward iterator from
//       a large std::forward_list and a large std::vector. How does the run-time
//       change with the number of elements in the container? (Try hundreds of
//       thousands or millions of elements.)
