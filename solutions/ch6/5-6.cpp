// 6-5. Using the example from Chapter 5, make Bank a template class that accepts a template parameter.
//      Use this type parameter as the type of an account rather than long.
//      Verify that your code still works using a Bank<long> class.
// 6-6. Implement an Account class and instantiate a Bank<Account>. Implement functions in Account to keep track of balances.
// 6-7. Make Account an interface. Implement a CheckingAccount and SavingsAccount.
//      Create a program with several checking and savings accounts.
//      Use a Bank<Account> to make several transactions between the accounts.
